                <p>2. Choose an anchor on the right, set your durations, click start, and follow the prompts.</p>
                <p>3. Bring your awareness to the animation and sync your breath with it's motion.</p>
                <p>4. As you relax, allow your gaze to soften so that you're looking past the animation instead of at it.</p>
                <p>5. Repeat often!</p>
                <p>This distraction will naturally fade away once your meditation begins.</p>
